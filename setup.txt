You need to get set up with two services in order to use this template.  If you are in a group, you can have one 
group member do this.

(A NOTE for MAC USERS: First, why? Just why. Mac installs python 2 and Python 3.
We are using python 3. I believe that python 3 that Mac installs will work but I have not
completed and install yet. To check, go to the Mac Terminal and type 'python3'. It should
report out that python 3.9 is installed.)

### Part one: Python Packagess ###

This assumes you have: 
1) installed Git (https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
    Git NOT github desktop
2) cloned the Capstone Flask Template (Which is what you are looking at now.)
3) Installed Anaconda - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
    (Mac users will not use Anaconda)

###### Install the Python Extension in VSC ########

1) Click the extensions icon on the left side of the screen. It looks like 4
    squares.
2) Search for and install the Python extension. It is the one created by Microsoft.
 You can also install it from this link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

##### Install the Python Packages #####

Now you need to install all of python packages.  To do this, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code. If it is not
already open then go to the Terminal menu and choose "New Terminal". If the terminal is set to "powershell" pull down the 
terminal menu and choose "select default shell" then pick "Command Prompt" from the menu that opens at the top of your screen. 
Then click the trash can in the terminal window pane and then open a new terminal. Now type the following commands:

# This command will install the tool you need to install Python Packages. 
# It may already be installed so we are going to update it.

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
(Mac users will type: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip)

# This command will install all the packages that are listed in the "requirements.txt" file

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
(mac users will type: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt)

# if you get an error that says you don't have access you need to use the '--user'
# option.  See the command below.  You can add --user to any pip command.
# python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt

You should see several packages being downloaded and installed.
You can check to see if it worked by clicking on the main.py to the left and then clicking the run button (triangle)
at the top right of the screen.  You should get an error about "pymongo". We will address that in the next step.

TEST YOUR PROGRESS: 
1) Click the Documents icon in the top left.
2) find main.py, click it. You should see a play button in the top right corner.
2a) If you don't see the play button, it is probably because you do not have the VSC Python extension 
    installed. A small popup window might have shown up in the bottom right of your
    VSC screen.  Click install!  If it didn't, click the extensions icon on the far 
    left of the screen. It looks like a set of 4 squares. Search for and install 'Python'.
3) When you click play you will probably get some errors.  If the error says something 
    like "there is no module named xxxxx" then install the module:
        python -m pip install xxxxx 
        (mac users: python3) 
        (if you get an access error use --user after install)
4) run main.py again.  Keep doing it until you don't get module errors. You will get 
    an error about app.utils.secrets or Jinja extensions.

### Hook up your database ###

The next is mongodb.com where you will create your database and all the data from your site will be stored.
1) I will describe the basic process to get an account at mongodb.com and find the 
    code you need to include in your app.
2) Sign up for an account at mongodb.com.  Click the "sign up" and NOT the "Try it Free" link.  This way you can
    create a new account with your google credentials.
3) You then going to get a free database "cluster".  Follow the instructions to create a new FREE cluster. You will be asked 
    which service you want to use (Google, AWS or Azure). Look at each to find a "Free Tier" that is close to us.
4) Click the connect button and then add 0.0.0.0 as the whitelist IP. This will make it possible to administer your 
    database from anywhere.  Also add and new database admin and password.  This password will be viwable by a lot of people 
    in class so don't use one that you already use for other important things.  Something simple like Admin and BullDogz.
5) Now you need to choose a connection method.  Click "Connect Your Application" and then configure the screen to give you the 
    code for Python 3.6 and above and click "Copy"
6) Copy the string that looks something like this:
    mongodb+srv://<dbuser>:<password>@cluster0-8m0v1.gcp.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority   
    and now you need to paste it in to your app. 
7) Go to the secrets-ChangeMe.py file and find MONGO_DB_NAME and MONGO_HOST keys. You need to add your values. Take a 
    look at the placeholder text to be sure you are adding the right strings. Then, change the file name to:
        secrets.py

### Run Main.py ###
1) Click the main.py file
2) Click the run triangle
3) Pray to the techno-gods
4) Hopefully, your site will start and be avalable at https://127.0.0.1:5000

### Set up an email account ###
This step is optional.  You only need it if you want your users to be able to recover their 
password via email if they forget. You should NOT use an email you currently use because you will need
to write the password in a place that is not 100% secure.  So, go to gmail.com and create a new email account.
Then add the address and the password the secrets file that is in the utils folder. 

You should be ready to go!

Run the main.py file.
